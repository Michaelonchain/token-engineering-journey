# Liquidity Engineering

Liquidity engineering is one of the most important parts of token engineering.  
It focuses on how tokens can be traded smoothly without big price swings.

This file is part of my journey into understanding how liquidity works in Web3.

## 🔹 What Is Liquidity?
Liquidity means how easily a token can be bought or sold without changing its price too much.

A token with good liquidity:
- Trades smoothly  
- Has less volatility  
- Attracts investors  
- Supports healthy growth  

A token with weak liquidity:
- Easily pumps and dumps  
- Scares investors  
- Has unstable pricing  

## 🔹 Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
Most tokens today use AMMs like:
- Uniswap  
- PancakeSwap  
- Raydium  
- Orca  

These AMMs use formulas to set prices automatically.

The most common formula is:

x × y = k

Where:
- x = token A in the pool  
- y = token B in the pool  
- k = constant product  

This is how price is determined in decentralized exchanges.

## 🔹 Liquidity Pools
A liquidity pool usually contains:
- The token  
- A pairing asset like USDC, SOL, ETH, etc.

For example:

100,000 TOKEN + 20,000 USDC

This creates a price for the token and allows trading.
## 🔹 Liquidity Strategies I’m Learning
1. Initial Liquidity Setup  
   How much liquidity a project should launch with.

2. Liquidity Locking  
   How to lock LP tokens to build trust.

3. Liquidity Migration  
   Moving liquidity between pools.
4. Liquidity Management  
   Adding or removing liquidity to stabilize price.

5. Protocol-Owned Liquidity  
   When the project owns its own liquidity (very powerful).

## 🔹 Why Liquidity Matters in Token Design
A strong liquidity system:
- Prevents big dumps  
- Reduces slippage  
- Keeps price stable  
- Makes the token trustworthy  
- Attracts long-term holders  
More detailed models will be added soon as I continue building and learning.
