# Tokenomics Overview

This document is part of my token engineering journey, where I study how tokens work, how value flows through blockchain systems, and how to design sustainable token models.

## 🔹 What Are Tokenomics?
Tokenomics is the economic system behind a crypto token. It includes:
- Token supply
- Distribution model
- Utility and use-cases
- Incentives for holders
- Emission & burn mechanics
- Governance

## 🔹 Why Tokenomics Matter
A well-designed token model helps a project:
- Grow sustainably  
- Attract long-term holders  
- Reduce dump pressure  
- Maintain liquidity  
- Build a healthy ecosystem  

## 🔹 What I’m Learning
As part of my token engineering journey, I’m focusing on:
1. How to calculate total and circulating supply  
2. Designing utility for real user behavior  
3. Vesting schedules & anti-dump systems  
4. Liquidity strategies  
5. Staking reward mechanisms  
6. Governance token design  

More documents will be added as I continue learning and building.
